Updraft
===========

Getting Started
---------------

To get started building Updraft:MOD, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html).

To initialize your local repository using the Updraft trees, use a command like this:

For the 4.4 branch, use

    repo init -u git://github.com/UpdraftDev/4.4.git

Then to sync up:

    repo sync
